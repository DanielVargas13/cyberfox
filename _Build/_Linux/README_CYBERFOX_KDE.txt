How to use:
Extract to /opt/ or install with install_kcyberfox.sh script and start Cyberfox. It MUST BE in /opt/, because otherwise it will work like standard edition, not like KDE Plasma Edition. You can also download and install optional KDE notification integration features, to do this, just type: sudo wget -O /usr/share/knotifications5/kcyberfoxhelper.notifyrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hawkeye116477/kcyberfoxhelper/master/kcyberfoxhelper.notifyrc
To make KCyberfox properly working you should have: libc6 (>= 2.23), libkf5configcore5 (>= 5.18), libkf5coreaddons5 (>= 5.18), libkf5i18n5 (>= 5.18), libkf5kiocore5 (>= 5.18), libkf5kiowidgets5 (>= 5.18), libkf5notifications5 (>= 5.18), libkf5service-bin, libkf5service5 (>= 5.18), libkf5windowsystem5 (>= 5.18), libqt5core5a (>= 5.6.1), libqt5gui5 (>= 5.6.1) | libqt5gui5-gles (>= 5.6.1), libqt5widgets5 (>= 5.6.1), libstdc++6 (>= 5.3)

How to update:
Delete your old cyberfox folder and replace it with the new one or use install_kcyberfox.sh script.
